# Portfolio Website 👨‍💻

Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository! This project marks my initial attempt at building a full-stack website with minimal knowledge in web development and frameworks. The entire website is hardcoded, reflecting my early stages of exploring the world of web development.

## Overview 👋
- **Learning Journey**: This repository captures my early steps in web development, showcasing a basic understanding of front-end and back-end interactions.
- **Front-end Structure**: The front-end is organized into folders, with the base containing all necessary files and subfolders to ensure proper functionality.
  - `assets/`: Includes images used on the website.
  - `css/`: Houses CSS files responsible for styling HTML elements.
  - `js/`: Contains JavaScript files for fetching data from my Portfolio SpringBoot backend repository.
  - `template/`: Encompasses all pages written in hardcoded HTML, providing a foundation for the website.

## What to Expect 🎯
While there might not be much to see on the surface, this project serves as a valuable starting point for someone extremely new to web development. Here, you can observe the structure of a hardcoded website, gaining insights into how different components come together.
